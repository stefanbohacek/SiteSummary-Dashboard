SiteSummary Dashboard
=====================

SiteSummary Dashboard is a simple AngularJS "web app" that serves as a little demo created for the free [SiteSummary](http://fourtonfish.com/sitesummary) API.

![Dashboard Example](http://fourtonfish.com/sitesummary/preview.png "Dashboard Example")

You don't need to know Angular to use the dashboard -- simply add your URLs to the `urls.txt` file (one per each line, no commas) and open `index.html`. The dashboard also supports full text search.


Feel free to extend this demo (convert it to jQuery/vanilla JavaScript, change the layout, add new functionality, such as saving the old values and showing the difference on reload etc).
